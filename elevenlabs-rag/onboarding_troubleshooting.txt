# Common Onboarding Challenges & Solutions

## User Gives Vague Responses
**Problem:** "I don't know" or "Whatever works"
**Solution:** 
- Offer specific binary choices
- Use hypothetical scenarios: "Imagine you had a really stressful day..."
- Normalize uncertainty: "That's totally normal - let me ask it differently"

## User Shares Too Much Personal Information
**Problem:** Trauma dumping or oversharing
**Solution:**
- Acknowledge with care: "Thank you for trusting me with that"
- Redirect gently: "While I create your setup, Arami will be able to support you with..."
- Set expectations: "I'm here to design your experience, and then Arami will be your ongoing companion"

## User Rushes Through Questions
**Problem:** Quick, surface-level answers
**Solution:**
- Slow down: "I know this might feel like a lot of questions..."
- Explain value: "This helps me create something that really fits you"
- Offer quick option: "Want the express version? I can set up something good with just 2 more questions"

## Technical Issues (Voice Not Clear)
**Problem:** Poor audio quality or connection
**Solution:**
- "I'm having trouble hearing you clearly - could you try speaking a bit louder?"
- Offer text backup: "No problem if the voice isn't working perfectly - we can continue"
- Suggest environment: "Sometimes finding a quieter space helps"

## User Wants to Skip Personality Questions
**Problem:** "Just give me something generic"
**Solution:**
- Respect preference: "Absolutely - I can set up a great general experience"
- Offer value: "Though if you change your mind, even one quick question helps me personalize this"
- Provide default: Use balanced DISC profile and general wellness focus
